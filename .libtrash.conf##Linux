# This setting controls the interception of calls to unlink(). If it is

INTERCEPT_UNLINK = YES
 
 
# This setting controls the interception of calls to rename(). If it is
# set to NO, the "real" rename() (the one found in GNU libc) will be
# used and data might be lost; if it set to YES, calls to rename() will

INTERCEPT_RENAME = YES


# This setting controls the interception of calls to fopen(). If it is

# intercepted and any truncated files will be stored in your trash can:
  
INTERCEPT_FOPEN = YES


# This setting controls the interception of calls to freopen(). If it is
# set to NO, the "real" freopen() (the one found in GNU libc) will be

INTERCEPT_FREOPEN = YES


# This setting controls the interception of calls to open(). If it is
# set to NO, the "real" open() (the one found in GNU libc) will be used
# and data might be lost; if it set to YES, calls to open() will be
# intercepted and any truncated files will be stored in your trash can:

INTERCEPT_OPEN = YES


# This setting sets the default name of the directory in the user's home
# directory in which "deleted" files will be stored. It mustn't contain
# any slashes:
  
TRASH_CAN = Trash


# This setting defines what should be done in case of failure: should we
# just call the desired function in GNU libc's using the argument we
# were passed or do nothing at all? (Note: There is one possible error
# situation in which we wouldn't even be able to invoke glibc's
# functions(): if the corresponding call to dlsym() had failed. The
# other possible errors are caused either by allocation failures, the
# impossibility to determine information about the user or by the fact
# that we were unable to create a file/directory. In any of these cases,
# we can always just pass our argument to the "real" function, if that
# is what the user prefers.) Please set it to either ALLOW_DESTRUCTION
# (to use the "real" GNU libc function, without the protection of
# libtrash) or PROTECT (to return an error code without invoking the
# appropriate function, making sure that even if an error occurs, that
# file won't be lost): 

IN_CASE_OF_FAILURE = PROTECT


# This setting defines whether, when libtrash is disabled (i.e., when
# the environmental variable TRASH_OFF is set), the user gets warned
# about that fact whenever one of the overriden functions is invoked.
# Set to either YES or NO:
  
SHOULD_WARN = NO


# This setting defines what we will do if asked to destroy a file under
# the user's TRASH_CAN. There is one thing we must refuse to do: handle
# it normally (i.e., storing a copy of it under TRASH_CAN/TRASH_CAN/).
# The file would never be deleted and you would get a chain of TRASH_CAN
# directories under your TRASH_CAN. So we can either protect the trash
# can (by setting this variable to YES), or allow direct destruction of
# files already inside it (by variable it to NO). Please note that, if
# you set this setting to NO, you will _NOT_ be fully protected from
# devastating commands such as
#
# 'rm -rf *'
#

# In this case, libtrash would store a copy of all "deleted" files under
# your TRASH_CAN, but would still allow the removal of all of them from
# your TRASH_CAN. (Depending on the order in which rm deletes files
# under your home dir, the consequences might vary: if it only tried to
# unlink() the files under TRASH_CAN _after_ having "deleted" all the
# others, you would lose everything; if, on the other hand, it first
# unlink()ed the files under TRASH_CAN and then proceeded to the others,
# you would just lose the files you had originally stored under
# TRASH_CAN itself). In other words, you probably want to set it to YES,
# and just set it to NO in the environment when you need to forcefully 
# remove files under your TRASH_CAN:

PROTECT_TRASH = YES


# This setting defines a semi-colon delimited list of file name
# extensions (i.e., file types) which should be "ignored": files with
# matching file names won't be copied into your trash can before being
# destroyed. To disable this feature, leave t. Note: You must NOT
# precede each extension with a dot; e.g., to ignore C source and header
# files, this setting should be set to 
#
# c;h
#
# NOT 
#
# .c;.h

IGNORE_EXTENSIONS = o;log;aux


# This setting defines whether hidden files (or files under a hidden
# directory) should be handled normally or "ignored". Usually, hidden
# files are either temporary or configuration files. Set to either YES
# or NO. YES tells libtrash to "ignore" such files, i.e., to allow their
# permanent destruction. Choosing NO causes them to be handled
# "normally", i.e., they will be moved to your trash can rather than
# really destroyed:
  
IGNORE_HIDDEN = NO


# This setting defines whether files whose names end in a tilde ('~')
# should be handled normally or really "ignored". Usually, these files
# are backup files used by text editors. Set to either YES or NO. YES
# tells libtrash to "ignore" such files, i.e., to allow their permanent
# destruction. Choosing NO causes them to be handled "normally", i.e.,
# they will be moved to your trash can rather than really destroyed:
  
IGNORE_EDITOR_BACKUP = YES


# This setting defines whether files whose names begin with a cardinal
# ('#') should be handled normally or "really" ignored. Usually, these
# files are temporary files used by text editors. Set to either YES or
# NO. YES tells libtrash to "ignore" such files, i.e., to allow their
# permanent destruction. Choosing NO causes them to be handled
# "normally", i.e., they will be moved to your trash can rather than
# really destroyed:

IGNORE_EDITOR_TEMPORARY = YES


# This setting allows you to instruct libtrash to never allow the
# destruction of your personal libtrash configuration file. The idea
# behind this variable is the following: if you accidentally issue a
# command which makes your personal libtrash configuration file
# "disappear", libtrash won't behave in the way you would expect it to
# behave, and you might not notice that until it is too late. This would
# be particularly serious if your variables differ from the compile-time
# defaults in important aspects. If you consider this additional
# protection useful, set this setting to YES; otherwise, choose NO (your
# libtrash configuration file will, in this case, be handled according
# to the other rules): 

LIBTRASH_CONFIG_FILE_UNREMOVABLE = YES


# This setting determines whether requests by users which would cause
# the destruction of a file outside of their home directory are
# intercepted, i.e., if such files are moved to the user's trash can or
# really destroyed. Of course, any of these things will only happen if
# the user has sufficient permissions. If you set this variable to YES,
# you should take a look at TRASH_SYSTEM_ROOT below. An example: Alice
# tries to unlink() / common / latest-news.txt. If you set
# GLOBAL_PROTECTION to YES, / common / latest-news.txt will be moved to
# / home / alice / Trash / SYSTEM_ROOT / common / latest-news.txt,
# assuming that TRASH_SYSTEM_ROOT is set to SYSTEM_ROOT. If
# GLOBAL_PROTECTION had the value NO, / common / latest-news.txt would
# be unlink()ed using glibc's unlink(), and no copy would be stored in
# Alice's TRASH_CAN. If Alice lacked write-permission to that directory
# in the first place, her request would naturally fail.
#
# NOTES:
#
# 1- This _DOESN'T_ apply to requests which would destroy files under
# one of the "protected" directories listed in UNREMOVABLE_DIRS: if the
# super user lists /lib in unremovable_dirs, and sets GLOBAL_PROTECTION,
# trying to unlink(), e.g., /lib/libc.so.6 will still fail: the original
# file (actually, it is a symlink) will be left in the same place, and
# it won't be copied to her TRASH_CAN. If GLOBAL_PROTECTION hadn't been
# set, exactly the same thing would have happened: this request would
# have been ignored. Summary: UNREMOVABLE_DIRS takes precedence over
# GLOBAL_PROTECTION. 
#
# 2- Files under TEMPORARY_DIRS are always ignored: e.g., requests to
# unlink() files under these dirs are passed on to glibc's unlink()
# independently of the value of GLOBAL_PROTECTION. It doesn't make any
# sense to allow storing back-up copies of temporary files; besides,
# this would make your TRASH_CAN unbrowsable due to the quantity of
# litter (pun intended). 
#
# 3- If you set GLOBAL_PROTECTION to YES, and then proceed to delete a
# file on a partition or file system different from the one on which
# your home directory resides, the file will be _copied_ byte-after-byte
# to your trash can. If the file is very large (e.g., ISO images), that
# operation will take some time.

GLOBAL_PROTECTION = YES


# This setting sets the default name of the directory under TRASH_CAN
# which will serve as "root" of the file system if you have set
# GLOBAL_PROTECTION above (if GLOBAL_PROTECTION is set to NO, this value
# is ignored). E.g.: if you set this setting to SYSTEM_ROOT, and
# GLOBAL_PROTECTION is set to YES, trying to unlink()
# /common/interesting-stuff/important.html will result in a copy of the
# deleted file in / (YOUR_HOME_DIR) / (YOUR_TRASH_CAN) / SYSTEM_ROOT /
# common / interesting-stuff / important.html. Just like TRASH_CAN, it
# musn't contain any slashes - it should be a plain directory name:

TRASH_SYSTEM_ROOT = SYSTEM_ROOT


# This variable defines a list of directories under which no files will
# ever be destroyed by the user running a program under libtrash. They
# won't be transferred to the user's TRASH_CAN: these requests are
# simply ignored and an error code is returned after each call to the
# "wrapped" functions. 
#
# NOTES: 
#
# 1- Each user can choose her own list of "untouchable" dirs.
#
# 2- root can use this variable to prevent catastrophic events which
# would render a system unusable, e.g., "rm -r /". Leave this setting
# empty (i.e., enter a newline after the equal sign) if you don't need
# this feature. Otherwise, fill in a semi-colon separated list of
# directories. A list of system directories which will prevent root
# from seriously damaging the system is provided as an alternative.
#
# 3- Directories can be easily removed from this list at run-time
# through the use of the UNCOVER_DIRS environmental variable (see
# below).

UNREMOVABLE_DIRS =/bin;/boot;/boot-partitions;/dev;/etc;/home/l;/lib;/lib64;/opt;/sbin;/usr;/windows_vm
#UNREMOVABLE_DIRS=/bin;/boot;/dev;/etc;/lib;/sbin;/usr

# This is a convenience configuration variable: it simply instructs
# libtrash to temporarily remove the listed directory(ies) from the
# UNREMOVABLE_DIRS variable. Additionally, it can also be used to
# override PROTECT_TRASH from the command line, so that you can
# permanently destroy files in your trash can without having to
# completely disable libtrash during that interval. I came up with this
# idea when I noticed that, more often than not, whenever I issued a
# command as root I was prefixing it with either "TRASH_OFF=YES" or
# "UNREMOVABLE_DIRS=''", because it would typically try either to
# perform changes in one of the UNREMOVABLE_DIRS or to permanently
# remove files from my trash can. For that reason, you can now easily
# remove the directory(ies) you are updating from UNREMOVABLE_DIRS
# without completely disabling libtrash. 
#
# Notes:
#
# 1- Since this variable lists exceptions to UNREMOVABLE_DIRS, it is
# empty by default and can't be set in the personal configuration file:
# it is meant to be used only at the command line (e.g.,
# "UNCOVER_DIRS=/usr/ rm /usr/foo"). 
#
# 2- You can set UNCOVER_DIRS to one or more subdirectories of a (higher
# level) directory listed in UNREMOVABLE_DIRS. This means that if you
# have set UNREMOVABLE_DIRS to /abc, and wish to delete everything
# beneath /abc/def/, you can use the command "UNCOVER_DIRS=/abc/def rm
# -R /abc/def" -- you only need to "uncover" what you wish to destroy or
# modify.
#
# 3- The format is the same as for UNREMOVABLE_DIRS: semi-colon
# separated list of directories, without any white-space in the middle
# and without quotes. To override PROTECT_TRASH, just list the path to
# your trash can.
#
# 4- AGAIN: (i) Leave UNCOVER_DIRS empty in this file. (ii) Don't set
# UNCOVER_DIRS in your personal configuration file. ==> (iii) Use it 
# only as an environmental variable.

UNCOVER_DIRS =


# This setting sets a list of directories under which temporary files
# are created. We always destroy files under any of these directories.
# This must be a semi-colon separated list of directories. Leave this
# setting empty (i.e., enter a newline after the equal sign) if you
# don't need/want this exception:

TEMPORARY_DIRS = /run;/tmp;/var

# This setting defines a list of directories inside each user's home 
# directory under which temporary files are created. We always destroy
# files under any of these directories. This must be a semi-colon 
# separated list of directory names *relative to the users' home dirs*,
# and with no leading or trailing slashes. Leave this setting empty 
# (i.e., enter a newline after the equal sign) if you don't need/want
# this exception.
#
# Example: setting
#
# USER_TEMPORARY_DIRS = temp
#
# will lead to the permanent destruction of deleted files beneath
# /root/temp, /home/user1/temp, /home/user2/temp, etc..., which might
# be useful if some program creates temporary files in /{$HOME}/temp
# whenever it is run.

USER_TEMPORARY_DIRS =


# This setting sets a list of directories under which files are really
# destroyed, exactly like what happens in the directories listed in
# TEMPORARY_DIRS. The only difference is that this variable is meant to
# be used to prevent files on removable media (e.g., floppies, CD-RW,
# etc) from having a copy of themselves "saved" in your trash can if
# GLOBAL_PROTECTION is set. It is enabled by default, since I suppose
# that for most people saving back-up copies of files destroyed on a
# removable medium doesn't make a lot of sense. For that reason, and to
# prevent those unnecessary copies from being made, fill in a semi-colon
# separated list of directories which are used as mount points for
# removable media in your system. If you wish to have that extra level
# of protection enabled, just leave this variable unset (i.e., enter a
# newline after the equal sign) - and don't forget to enable 
# GLOBAL_PROTECTION, of course):

# NOTE: This variable is ignored if global_protection is disabled.

REMOVABLE_MEDIA_MOUNT_POINTS = /key;/media;/mnt


# This setting is meant to allow certain programs to function correctly
# while libtrash is enabled. More specifically, it can be used to create
# a list of "exceptions": files which would normally be considered
# unremovable lose their protection if listed here. This is important
# because some programs might need to delete files in UNREMOVABLE_DIRS;
# e.g., the commands mount/umount need to create/delete a lock file in
# /etc, while it is usually a good idea to mark /etc as unremovable. You
# can also use this variable to make libtrash work from /etc/ld.so.preload
# without interfering with your boot/shutdown procedure.
#
# Notes: 
# 
# 1) Use a semi-colon separated list, no white-space between items.
# 
# 2) Not only files with a path listed in EXCEPTIONS lose their
# protection; any file with a path *starting* with one of the paths
# listed here loses its protection (eg, both /usr/abcd and /usr/abc/d
# will lose their protection if /use/abc is listed here). This is a
# feature -- not a bug -- so that mount can delete any file with a name
# starting with /etc/mtab.

EXCEPTIONS = /etc/mtab;/etc/resolv.conf;/etc/adjtime;/etc/upsstatus;/etc/dhcpc


# Files which match this regular expression will be ignored.
#
# WARNING:
# In the configuration file used at compile time all backslashes MUST be
# double, but in the personal configuration files they MUST NOT be double.
# (This is due to the fact that the C compiler interprets the backslash as
# an escape character.)
#
 
IGNORE_RE =

# End of configuration.
