; Three backends are currently supported:
;
;  - growlnotify (v2)   Mac OS X   "gntp" must be installed
;  - gobject            Linux      python gobject must be installed
;  - pynotify           Linux      "pynotify" must be installed
;
; To configure, adjust the settings below.  Note that neither of the
; "sticky" options have any effect on Linux with pynotify.  They only work
; for growlnotify.
